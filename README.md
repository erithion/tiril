# Tiril
Tiril is an open source software aiming to assist in a language learning process.

While it still exists in a form of Proof-Of-Concept with lots of ideas still to be implemented, the following components have already been added
* Tiril - a server. To date it operates merely dictionaries and handles just a few of them for now:
  * [x] [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com)
  * [x] [Lexin](http://lexin.udir.no)
* Viril - a [VideoLAN](https://github.com/videolan) plugin to translate subtitles. Among supported formats are:
  * [x] Embedded and external SubRip 
  * [ ] ASS/SSA possibility has been confirmed and awaits implementation
  
Below you can see a demonstration of how Tiril already strives to be helpful to you by having taught VLC media player to do something new in spite of having grown so small yet.
