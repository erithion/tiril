# Tiril
Tiril is an open source software aiming to assist in a language learning process.

It's written in Haskell and C++ mainly, save a couple of other languages for the minor needs. While it is still in a Proof-Of-Concept form with lots of ideas awaiting to be implemented, the following components have already been added
* Tiril - a server. To date it can operate dictionaries. And only with a few of them for now:
  * [x] Google Translate
  * [x] Lexin
* Viril - a [VideoLAN](https://github.com/videolan) plugin to translate subtitles. Formats:
  * [x] Embedded and external SubRip 
  * [ ] ASS/SSA possibility has been confirmed and awaits implementation
  
Below is a demonstration of how Tiril already strives to help you by having taught VLC media player to do something new.
