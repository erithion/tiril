# Tiril
Tiril is an open source software aiming to assist in a language learning process.

It's written in Haskell and C++ mainly, save a couple of other languages for the minor needs. While it is still in a Proof-Of-Concept form with lots of ideas awaiting to be implemented, the following components have already been done
* Tiril - a server. Supports Google Translate and Lexin dictionaries for now. 
* Viril - a [VideoLAN](https://github.com/videolan) plugin to translate subtitles. Supports embedded and external Subrip format of subtitles. ASS/SSA possibility has also been confirmed and awaits implementation.

Below is a demonstration of how Tiril and one of its clients, the VideoLAN plugin, operate to date.
