**Tiril** is an open source software aiming to assist in a language learning process. At the current stage of development when the project hasn't even reached an alpha yet, it doesn't have a stable set of features, for they change and merge into each other rather rapidly. Luckily, a display of learning approaches which become easier with Tiril serves as a much better showcase for the project.

# The showcase

## I enjoy watching movies. I wouldn't mind to learn while watching on occasion

Watching a movie in a language of the original with subtitles turned on - what a nice way to boost your language skills! Indeed, the very thought of making your leisure time productive seems ever so tempting that it is hard to resist really. Only it's the necessity to look for translations of every new word is what makes the process so tiresome. "I wish there was a way to avoid of being buried under the piles of dictionaries in the process", - you say. "In fact there is a way!", - Tiril responds. 
</p>
Let us assume for the sake of the demonstration that you've decided to watch a Norwegian movie. In <a href="https://github.com/videolan">VLC</a> - a very powerful and popular open source video player - Tiril will give you this.

## I'm old school. I'd rather a good book instead

It's about reading the book in a language of the original alongside some inserts or translation in your mother tongue. Here one finds not so many solutions let alone the decent ones. One of them is Kindle. The other solution is a free application for Android devices called [SmartBook](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kursx.smartbook&hl=en). Yet as soon as you step out beyond the "mainstream" set of European languages or books, you are on your own. Don't despare, though, Tiril will help you again. Let's assume you would like to read Sherlock Holmes in Norwegian-English. Check out below how you could assemble yourself such a book with Tiril for SmartBook application.
</p>
Searching for the text of the books in both languages is nearly the hardest part throughout the entire process. But once it is done, everything else is easy. Start from opening them in Tiril

</details>
<br>
The books need to be aligned in order for SmartBook application to show the proper translation under each paragraph. The rules are simple and intuitive - just keep the same number of chapters and paragraphs in both books or merge/create new paragraphs if needed. The number of empty rows between two paragraphs doesn't matter, for only non-empty ones are accounted, but this trick often improves visual comparison so feel free to use it.

... you can enjoy your reading. Mind you though that SmartBook application shows the author's translation for English-Russian books only. This is a limitation set by the creator of the application. Thus you will have to set this direction in the options to see the translation you have supplied with your book. Otherwise the application will show you a translation from Google Translate

## I prefer none of the above. But I surf foreign websites a lot

*TBD*

## I want to remember every new word I encounter for good

There are lots of automated solutions for efficient memorizing, like Anki, Memrise, Quizlet and alike. It won't take long for you to realize what a relief it is actually, when the software is tracking which word you are to learn/recollect today. But also what a tremendous amount of effort it would need to maintain your own dictionary. 
With Tiril this is a problem no more. It knows your vocabulary well for it translated the movie pieces ~~and the web-pages~~ for you, remember? Below is an example of how Tiril would help you to export your dictionary to Memrise.
</p>
The left pane contains your recent words. The right pane gives you the content of the various online dictionaries. They say you learn faster if you memorize words as parts of phrases or sentences. So you are free to choose what you preserve with the word

</details>
<br>
Memrise requires _at least_ two columns. Use filtering by tags to split your export into the columns. Delete the elements you don't need or drag the elements with the mouse if you can't apply the proper filter

# The pantry

## Structure

Tiril was conceived as a client-server app where the server would take the burden of handling a continuously extending list of online dictionaries and maintaining the user database whereas its "client" would be a growing set of agents requesting translations from it. That guarantees Tiril's presence virtually everywhere so that the user might count upon the translation regardless of whether he is watching a movie in a media player, surfing the Internet in a browser or working with textual information of any other kind. 
Currently Tiril consists of      
* Siril - the server with an embedded UI. 
* Viril - a [VLC](https://github.com/videolan) agent to translate subtitles.
* ...

### Siril

Supports dictionaries

* Universal dictionaries
  * [x] [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com)
  * [ ] ...
* Specialized dictionaries
  * [x] [Lexin (Norwegian BokmÃ¥l)](http://lexin.udir.no)
  * [ ] [Teanglann (Irish)](https://www.teanglann.ie/)
  * [ ] ...

### Viril 

Supports subtitle formats

  * [x] Embedded and external SubRip 
  * [ ] ASS/SSA possibility has been confirmed and awaiting implementation
  * [ ] ...


## Build
### Prerequisites

Some of the project dependencies might seem unexpected, ~~like Electron JS for example~~. Yet the project has scripts that seek for making the build process as effortless as possible by automatically downloading every single library that the project depends on. However there are some steps one is manually to perform. The following must be installed prior to proceed with the build

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) (>=3.12.0)
* [Haskell Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) (>=1.6.3)
* C++ compiler whith C++17 support. For an instance, [MSVC Community](https://www.visualstudio.com/free-developer-offers/) will do
* [Boost library](https://www.boost.org/users/download/) (>=1.67)
* ~~[Electron](https://electronjs.org)~~

### Windows
* Review *config.bat* and set the Boost path according to your environment. Tweak the other variables if needed.  
* Run *config.bat*
* Run *build.bat*

### Linux

*TBD*

## ToDo
The section is mainly for the author to keep track of the emerging needs/ideas

* Siril server
  * [ ] Add Haskell Conduit HTTP streams to parse dictionaries on-demand and speed up UI page show ups
  * [ ] Research: Consider FRP model of Threepenny GUI and evaluate if it would  reduce the amount of type-unsafe Javascript on UI-side.
  * Dictionaries
    * [ ] Gaeilge support: add [Teanglann](https://www.teanglann.ie/) parser
    * [ ] Norsk bokmÃ¥l support: add [bÃ¸yningsformer](http://inger.uib.no/perl/search/search.cgi?appid=72&tabid=1106) parser
  * Export
    * [ ] Implement exporting to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net)
    * [ ] Introduce a sed-like syntax in export pages to format the output at will
    * [ ] Add single word editing
  * Tools
    * [x] Add creation of [SmartBooks](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kursx.smartbook&hl=en)
  * [ ] Move UI to a standalone Electron-app
  * [ ] Implement the server as an OS daemon
  * [ ] Add Activity page
* Viril agent
  * [ ] Add ASS/SSA subitles support
  * [ ] Extended phrases selection
  * [ ] Mouse selection support
  * [ ] Add Options to control keyboard shortcuts etc
  * [ ] Siril no-connection screen logo
* Web agent
  * [ ] Opera
  * [ ] Chrome
  * [ ] Firefox
  * [ ] Saving Duolingo forum's notes with tags and searching
* Android agent (daemon)
  * [ ] [SmartBook library](http://smart-book.net) requests: intercept and allow to choose between a local books storage and the default one
* Linux build
